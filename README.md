# Random Forests by Team FERDA
In this lesson, students will learn about Random Forests and their implmentation by helping Jones, a collector of High MPG Vehicles. The notes, slides and assignment will first provide a recap on decision trees. In doing so, Gini Entropy and Information Gain will be covered. The disadvantages of decision trees will then be introduced, primarily issues with too high of variance and instability problems.

In helping Jones, students will have to modify and clean the dataset of information on cars and
