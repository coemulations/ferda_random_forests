# Random Forests by Team FERDA
This assignments learning objectives are to ensure that students understand:
- Structure and Intuition behind Decision Trees
- Entropy vs Gini Impurity
- Disadvantages of Decision Trees and how Random Forests can fix them
- How to use Random Forests for an industry classification task
- Using Decision Tree and Random Forest visualization to understand what splits are made to classify datapoints.
- Reporting information on splits in an efficient manner.

### Changes to be made:
- (Notes) Ensure students understand Decision Trees
- (Notes) Add more about baggind and feature selection
- (Code) Change usage of pure accuracy to assess classifiers to ROC curve + add understanding as to why this metric would be useful for "Jones"
- (Code) Add task of creating random forest for Iris dataset https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html and have students perform feature analysis
- (Code, Potential) Add tasks of calculating feature importance.
- (Code, Potential)? Add task of scaling data and seeing how that affects accuracy (once real features have been assessed)
